# Tweets Generator

**Generate random tweets using Markov Chains.**

## 💀 Description
Tweets Generator is a program that uses Markov Chains to generate realistic tweets based on input text. The system learns from sample texts and creates new tweets by predicting the most probable next words.

## 🔧 Installation
To compile and run the program, use the following commands:
```bash
g++ -o tweet_generator tweet_generator.cpp
./tweet_generator input.txt
```

## 🚀 Technologies Used
- **C++** (Core implementation)
- **Markov Chains** (Statistical text prediction)

## 📝 Features
- Learns from input text files.
- Generates realistic, probabilistic tweets.
- Supports multiple iterations for refining text output.

## 🌟 Future Improvements
- Adding support for **N-gram models** to improve sentence coherence.
- Integration with **Twitter API** to generate real-time tweets.
- GUI interface for easy interaction.
