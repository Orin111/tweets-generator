  <p align="center">
    <b>Natural Language Processing</b> is the 3rd (Part A) exercise I've solved in Huji's <b>Programming Workshop in C & C++</b> course.
    <br>
    The main idea behind this exercise is to get familiar with <b>Markov Chains</b>, <b>Dynamic Arrays</b> and <b>Memory Management</b>.

## Project Description

This project generates tweets using Markov chains. The program accepts several parameters:

- Seed value
- Number of tweets to generate (n)
- Path to the corpus file (a file that contains sentences/tweets)
- Number of words to read from the file (optional; if not provided, the entire file is read)

The program generates 'n' tweets, each with a maximum length of 20 words.
