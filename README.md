## Project Description

This project generates tweets using Markov chains. The program accepts several parameters:

- Seed value
- Number of tweets to generate (n)
- Path to the corpus file (a file that contains sentences/tweets)
- Number of words to read from the file (optional; if not provided, the entire file is read)

The program generates 'n' tweets, each with a maximum length of 20 words.
